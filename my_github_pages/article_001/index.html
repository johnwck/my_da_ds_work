    <h1>Another Use of Hierarchical Clustering</h1>
    <br>
    <br>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>1. &nbspThe department developed a new method to do a task to reduce its duration.</p>
    <p>2. &nbspAn experiment was designed, planned and run.</p>
    <p>3. &nbspData on the (a) duration, (b) hour of day, and (c) method were collected for analysis.</p>
    <br>
    <br>

    <h2>Result</h2>
    <p>There was no significant difference in the task duration between the control and new methods.</p>

    <br>
    <br>

    <h2>Next Step - The Why</h2>
    <p>1. &nbspHierarchical Clustering was used to analyse the data.</p>
    <p>2. &nbspThe (a) duration, (b) hour of day, and (c) method were input variables to the analysis.</p>
    <br>
    <br>

    <h2>Result</h2>
    <p>1. &nbspThere were 2 distinct clusters in the dendrogram.</p>

    <p>2. &nbspCluster 1 has:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Marginally lower hour of day</li>
        <li>Significantly lower task duration</li>
        <li>Higher count of new method</li>
    </ul>
    <img src="https://johnwck.github.io/my_da_ds_work/my_github_pages/article_001/stage_03.png" width="100%">
    <p>3. &nbspHypothesis: New method with lower task duration are found in the early hours of the day.</p>
    <br>
    <br>

    <h2>Confirmation/Disconfirmation of Hypothesis</h2>
    <p>1. &nbspIt is true that the task duration of new method is only lower between 12 am and 8 am.</p>
