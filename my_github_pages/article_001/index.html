        <h1>Another Use of Hierarchical Clustering</h1>
        <br>
        <br>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>1. &nbspThe team developed a new method to do a task to reduce its duration.</p>
        <p>2. &nbspAn experiment was designed, planned, and run to qualify the new method.</p>
        <p>3. &nbspData on the (a) duration, (b) hour of day, and (c) method were collected for analysis.</p>
        <br>
        <br>

        <h2>Result</h2>
        <p>The new method has marginally lower task duration than the control method.</p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <h2>Next Step - The Why</h2>
        <p>1. &nbspHierarchical Clustering was used to mine the data for insights.</p>
        <p>2. &nbspThe (a) duration, (b) hour of day, and (c) method were used as input variables to the analysis.</p>
        <br>
        <br>

        <h2>Result</h2>
        <p>1. &nbspThere were 2 distinct clusters in the dendrogram.</p>
        <img src="https://johnwck.github.io/my_da_ds_work/my_github_pages/article_001/stage_02.png" width="70%">
        <p>2. &nbspCluster 1 has:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Marginally lower hour of day</li>
            <li>Significantly lower task duration</li>
            <li>Higher count of new method</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="https://johnwck.github.io/my_da_ds_work/my_github_pages/article_001/stage_03.png" width="100%">
        <p>3. &nbspHypothesis: The new method in the early hours of the day has lower task duration.</p>
        <br>
        <br>

        <h2>Confirmation/Disconfirmation of Hypothesis</h2>
        <p>1. &nbspIt is true that the task duration of the new method is only lower than the control method between 12 am and 8 am.</p>

        <p>2. &nbspThis insight provided a direction for the team to dive into to understand this phenomenon.</p>
