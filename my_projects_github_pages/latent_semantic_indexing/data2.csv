fashion,google,"Fashion is most often thought of as a global industry that is invested in anticipating what we wear and how we wish to appear to others. But fashion isn’t just a business. It’s also a cultural and social phenomenon, driven by the desire for the new. As such, the industry can never fully control fashion: fashion is all about being open to change."
fashion,lost_&_found,"Once a survival tool to shelter from the cold, fashion has evolved into an expression of our personality: not only for the choice of garments but for what each garment serves ornamentally, symbolically, and socially. Since the 13th century, fashion has influenced entire populations by allowing people to display their social status through clothing, especially the upper classes’ wealth and power. Throughout the centuries, the appreciation for fashion and beauty grew stronger. The formal dress worn in courts of the 17th century demonstrates the evolution of clothing: Creating a privileged environment where the constant creation and transformation of new trends could happen. “Pue” dolls circulated in royal palaces, dressed to reflect various trends. They were real models who informed the aristocracy about the latest fashions (the ancestors of the more accessible fashion figures in newspapers)."
fashion,textile_industry,"Fashion refers to how people dress, as well as the styles and designs that are popular or in trend for a specific period. It is an ever-evolving art form that can reflect the lifestyle, values, attitudes, and beliefs of a society. Different society, culture, entity, history prevails in different taste in fashion. Fashion can also be seen as a form of self-expression, allowing individuals to show up their thinking and taste in lifestyle. It also reveals one’s personality through the clothes one wears."
fashion,britannica,"Fashion industry, multibillion-dollar global enterprise devoted to the business of making and selling clothes. Some observers distinguish between the fashion industry (which makes “high fashion”) and the apparel industry (which makes ordinary clothes or “mass fashion”), but by the 1970s the boundaries between them had blurred. Fashion is best defined simply as the style or styles of clothing and accessories worn at any given time by groups of people. There may appear to be differences between the expensive designer fashions shown on the runways of Paris or New York and the mass-produced sportswear and street styles sold in malls and markets around the world. However, the fashion industry encompasses the design, manufacturing, distribution, marketing, retailing, advertising, and promotion of all types of apparel (men’s, women’s, and children’s) from the most rarefied and expensive haute couture (literally, “high sewing”) and designer fashions to ordinary everyday clothing—from couture ball gowns to casual sweatpants. Sometimes the broader term “fashion industries” is used to refer to myriad industries and services that employ millions of people internationally."
fashion,sew_guide,"What I know about “what is fashion” is simple – Fashion is how you present yourself. It is the art of expressing your sense of beauty through clothes. But it has more nuances than this simple definition suggests. Fashion is dressing in clothes that bring out the best of your body while impressing to others the excellent taste of the wearer. From a broader perspective, it is also a reflection of the society we live in, influenced by trends that are popular in mainstream culture."
