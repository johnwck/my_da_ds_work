# **Impact of SQL Query Design and Index Usage on Data Extraction Duration**
<br>

## <u>**Context**</u>
<br>

Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) is a process that converts DATA from the source system, to INFORMATION in the data warehouse, for analysis and modelling to build KNOWLEDGE.
<br>
<br>

Hence the desired output / outcome of the ETL process is:
* Information is complete
* Information is correct
* Information is on-time
* Information acquisition is low-cost (move, compute, store)
* Information acquisition is low-load on database for other users
<br>
<br>

The drivers of the desired output / outcome are:
* SQL query design
* Index usage
* Database settings
* Database load of other users
* Data model design
<br>
<br>

In this work, my objective is to explore the impact of SQL query design and index usage on the data extraction duration. When done effectively and efficiently, they can result in on-time information and low-load on database for other users in information acquisition to achieve the desired output / outcome of the ETL process.
<br>
<br>

I have included the database (using DB Browser for SQLite) and the 9 SQL queries for your use. Watch out! The SQL query will generate 143 million rows of data! You can follow the slides (in PDF) on how to use them.
<br>
<br>

That's it, folks! Hope you find this work useful. Feel free to connect with me in LinkedIn. Have a good day!
