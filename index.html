    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>Hello there! Welcome to my Data Analytics and Data Science website hosted by <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a>. It "is a static site hosting service that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files straight from a repository on GitHub, optionally runs the files through a build process, and publishes a website." This website is done from scratch through applying what I have learned, including <a href="https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/" target="_blank">Google Analytics</a>.</p>

    <p>My other objective is to share articles of my experiences through my works. They can be unorthodox. They can even be counterintuitive. I want to generate discussions through connections with me in LinkedIn. This is one of the ways we can learn from each other to progress.</p>

    <p>I have experiences in product engineering, process engineering, financial accounting, supply chain planning and stocking, training and consulting, operations management, and vendor management. The commonality between them is process and product improvement using data analytics and data science.</p>

    <p>I am educated in Physics, Business Administration, Travel and Tourism, Data Analytics, and Data Science.</p>

    <p>Connect with me in LinkedIn. See you!</p>
